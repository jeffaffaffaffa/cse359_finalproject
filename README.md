Project Concept:
How can we demonstrate different systems of power that exist in decentralized systems and the effects of those systems?

There are different levels of decentralization when it comes to these systems. Sometimes these systems are backed by leadership teams (Brave) self-serving foundations (such as Cardano), other times itâ€™s driven exclusively by developers, a single individual, or...nobody (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations).

How do the people heading a decentralized system exert and maintain power in a supposedly decentralized system?

In the question of maintaining power, attacks on power can also be made, such as notorious 50% attacks.

In the span of the next months, our team will create a visual, interactive experience where people can understand different power structures in decentralized systems.
